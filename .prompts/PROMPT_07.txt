Add Ludwig workflows in a way that is honest about what is feasible on M3 Pro 18GB.

Dependencies:
- Add ludwig to pyproject dependencies if it can be installed reasonably.
- If Ludwig brings heavy deps, implement as an “optional extra”:
  - [project.optional-dependencies]
  - ludwig = ["ludwig[llm]"] (or appropriate) and document how to install via `uv sync --extra ludwig`.

Create docs:
- docs/ludwig_workflows.md
Explain:
- Prompting vs ICL vs fine-tuning
- What can run locally on 18GB
- How to keep datasets tiny and runs short

Create datasets:
- data/ludwig/prompting.jsonl (50-150 rows, small)
- Include an instruction-style task aligned with the corpus domain (CLI/RAG tips).

Create configs:
- ludwig/prompting.yaml (runnable)
- ludwig/icl.yaml (if supported; otherwise “template” clearly marked)
- ludwig/tiny_finetune.yaml (template; only runnable if feasible)

Create scripts:
- scripts/run_ludwig_prompting.sh
- Must run at least one Ludwig workflow successfully if installed.

Verification:
- Document exact `uv` commands to install extras and run the workflow.
