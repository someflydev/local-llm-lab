Create docs/models.md with a practical, hardware-aware guide.

Must include:
- Why Llama 3 is the default.
- Why 8B-class models are the realistic sweet spot for 18GB unified memory.
- Why num_ctx defaults to 4096 and when to try 8192.
- Storage strategy with ~115GB free:
  - recommend minimal pulls
  - suggest removing unused models

Include a table:
Task | Default model | Default settings | Why | When to change

Ensure:
- You NEVER assume candidates (deepseek/kimi) exist.
- You explain how `lab models status` and `lab models recommend` work.

Also add:
- docs/operators_guide.md
This should mirror the Operator’s Guide steps (brew installs, starting ollama, minimal model pulls, uv python install).
