Now that the repo is runnable, generate the real README.md.

README must include:
1) What this lab is
2) Quickstart:
   - ./scripts/bootstrap_mac.sh
   - uv run lab doctor
   - uv run lab models recommend --task chat
   - uv run lab chat --prompt "hello"
3) RAG tutorial:
   - uv run lab ingest ...
   - uv run lab rag ...
4) Eval tutorial:
   - uv run lab run --config ...
   - uv run lab report ...
5) Profiling tutorial:
   - uv run lab profile ...
6) Web UI (optional):
   - uv run lab web ...
7) Ludwig workflows:
   - how to install optional extras
   - how to run prompting workflow
8) Troubleshooting checklist:
   - ollama not running
   - no models installed
   - embeddings model missing
   - slow performance / swap pressure
   - context too large
9) Appendices:
   - Glossary (20+ terms)
   - “First 60 minutes” learning path

Also create:
- docs/glossary.md (20+ terms; overlap with README is fine)
- docs/rag_deep_dive.md (clear beginner explanation + how this repo implements RAG)
- docs/neural_networks_101.md (non-mathy, conceptual)

Glossary terms must include at least:
LLM, Neural Network, Transformer, Attention, Token, Context Window, Inference,
Prompt, System Prompt, Temperature, Hallucination, RAG, Embedding, Vector Store,
Cosine Similarity, Chunking, Retrieval, Evaluation, Fine-tuning, In-context Learning,
Quantization, Unified Memory.

Verification checklist at end:
- doctor passes (or warns)
- chat works
- ingest works
- retrieve works
- rag works (including refusal)
- run/report works
- profile works
- web works (optional)
