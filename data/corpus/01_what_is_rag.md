# What RAG Is

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combines search with generation. The system first retrieves relevant chunks from a local corpus and then asks a chat model to answer using only that retrieved context.

RAG helps reduce hallucination risk because the model is grounded in explicit documents. It does not guarantee correctness, but it makes answers easier to inspect because the sources can be cited.
