# Local LLM Lab Structure

This lab keeps code in `src/lab`, helper scripts in `scripts`, example data in `data`, experiment configs in `experiments`, and runtime outputs in `runs`.

The goal is a repo that can run locally with Ollama and no external services. Commands are exposed through a single `lab` CLI.
