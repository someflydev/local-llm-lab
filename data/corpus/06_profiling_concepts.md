# Profiling Concepts

Profiling in this lab focuses on practical latency and throughput proxies. The goal is to compare settings and models under repeatable prompts instead of chasing perfect benchmarks.

Useful knobs include context size, retrieved chunk count, and model size. Smaller settings often improve responsiveness on constrained hardware.
